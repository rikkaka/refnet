# Refnet
In this project, I use [Crossref API](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/) to fetch the metadata of academic papers, cache them in a local sqlite database, and calculate the importance of papers based on the [CiteRank algorithm](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/2007/06/P06010). I also write a web UI to visualize the most important articles under the reference network of a given paper. You can also generate a literature review  based on these papers with an OpenAI api key easily.

## Pre-requisites
- rustc and cargo
- pnpm

## Usage
Required environment varibales:
- `LOCAL_ADDR` (Backend address. Default to 127.0.0.1:3030)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (Required if you need literature reviews generated by GPT)

Required environment varibales in `frontend/.env`:
- `VITE_API_URL` (Through which the frontend call the backend APIs. As http://127.0.0.1:3030)
- `VITE_WS_URL` (As ws://127.0.0.1:3030)

Then run with:
```sh
# dev mode
make dev
# release mode
make run
```
Then visit to your `LOCAL_ADDR` in the browser.
