# Refnet
In this project, I use Crossref API to fetch the metadata of academic papers, cache them in a local sqlite database, and calculate the importance of papers based on the [CiteRank algorithm](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/2007/06/P06010). I also write a web UI to show the most important articles under the reference network of a given paper. You can easily generate a literature review based on these papers with an OpenAI api key.

## Pre-requisites
- rustc and cargo
- pnpm

## Usage
request environment varibales:
- LOCAL_ADDR (Backend address. Default to 127.0.0.1:3030)
- VITE_API_URL (Through which the frontend call the backend APIs. As http://127.0.0.1:3030)
- VITE_WS_URL (As ws://127.0.0.1:3030)
- OPENAI_API_KEY (Required if you need literature reviews generated by GPT)

Then run with:
```sh
# dev mode
make dev
# release mode
make run
```
Then see the interface in your browser.
